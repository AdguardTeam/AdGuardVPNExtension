#### Install local dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Manage environment variables

- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it with required config data
- Also, you can provide environment variables through command line like this:

```text
STAGE_ENV=test \
VPN_API_URL="vpn_api_url" \
AUTH_API_URL="auth_api_url" \

```

### <a name="linting"></a> Linting

```bash
pnpm lint
```

### <a name="tests"></a> Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

### <a name="build"></a> Build

#### Dev version

```bash
pnpm dev
```

#### Beta version

```bash
pnpm beta
```

#### Release version

```bash
pnpm release
```

**Builds will be located in the `build` directory**

By default, you will have builds for all browsers:

- Chrome — manifest versions **3**
- Firefox — manifest version **3**
- Edge — manifest version **3**
- Opera — manifest version **3**

You can specify browser in arguments. See examples below:

```bash
pnpm dev chrome
pnpm release opera
```

### <a name="dev-bundle-size-monitoring"></a> Bundle Size Monitoring

The browser extension project includes a comprehensive bundle size monitoring system, located in `tools/bundle-size`. This system helps ensure that our extension bundles remain within defined size limits, and that any significant increases are reviewed and justified.

#### Key Features

- Tracks and compares bundle sizes across different build types (`beta`, `release`, etc.) and browser targets (`chrome`, `chrome-mv3`, `edge`, etc.)
- Detects significant size increases using configurable thresholds (default: 10%)
- Checks for duplicate package versions using `pnpm`
- Stores historical size data in `.bundle-sizes.json`
- Designed for CI/CD integration (Bamboo)
- **For Firefox target only**, every individual `.js` file is checked to ensure it does not exceed the 4MB limit imposed by the Firefox Add-ons Store. If any `.js` file is larger than 4MB, the check fails and the offending files are reported. Also checks total size for Firefox is less than 200MB.**

#### How it works

- On each beta or release build, the system compares the current bundle sizes to the reference values in `.bundle-sizes.json`.
- If any size exceeds the configured threshold, or additionally check 4MB limit for Firefox targets - the check fails.
- Duplicate package versions are detected and reported.

#### To update the bundle sizes manually

We have defined size limits in the project.

1. When we build the `beta` or `release` version, the build process checks if we’re exceeding those limits.
2. If we exceed the limits, the developer should investigate the cause and decide whether the size increase is acceptable.
3. If the new sizes are justified, the developer updates the size values in the package and creates a commit.
4. We then review and approve any changes to the sizes as part of the PR process.

##### Steps:

1. Run the build for the desired environment (e.g., `pnpm beta` or `pnpm release`). Make sure to build firefox because it's built separately (e.g., `pnpm beta firefox`).
2. If the build fails due to bundle size limits, investigate the cause (e.g., new dependencies, large assets).
3. If the increase is justified, update the reference sizes by running:

    ```shell
    pnpm bundle-size update <buildEnv> [targetBrowser]
    # Example:  pnpm bundle-size update beta firefox
    # Or: pnpm bundle-size update beta chrome
    ```
4. Commit the updated `.bundle-sizes.json` file and include justification in your PR.
5. The changes will be reviewed and approved as part of the PR process.

#### Checking bundle size locally

To check bundle sizes locally, use:

```shell
pnpm bundle-size check <buildEnv> [targetBrowser]
# Example: pnpm bundle-size check release chrome
# Or: pnpm bundle-size check beta firefox
```

Note: When you run `pnpm bundle-size check beta`, firefox is not checked.

For CLI help on parameters, use:

```shell
pnpm bundle-size --help
```

#### Usage: Custom Threshold

You can override the default threshold for significant bundle size increases using the `--threshold` option:

```sh
pnpm bundle-size check <buildEnv> [targetBrowser] --threshold 5
# or
pnpm bundle-size check release chrome --threshold=20
# or
pnpm bundle-size check beta
```

- `--threshold <number>`: Sets the allowed percentage increase in bundle size before the check fails. Default: 10%.

This is useful for temporarily relaxing or tightening the allowed size delta for a specific check/build.

### Update resources

Before releasing new versions do not forget to update exclusions-services data, which will be used for migration if remote data was not received from the servers.

### Artifact builds

#### `crx` builds

Before building `crx` make sure you have [built](#build)
the extension and also make sure you have added credentials:

- `certificate-beta.pem` - chrome crx beta certificate
- `certificate-release.pem` - chrome crx release certificate,

to the directory `./private/AdguardVPN`.

For testing purposes for `crx:dev` command credentials taken from `./tests/certificate-test.pem` file.

WARNING: DO NOT USE TEST CREDENTIALS FOR PRODUCTION BUILDS, BECAUSE THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN PUBLIC.

If you want to generate your own credentials you can go to
[How to generate credentials for `crx` builds](#how-to-generate-credentials-for-crx-builds) for more details

To build `crx`, run:

- `pnpm crx:dev`
- `pnpm crx:beta`
- `pnpm crx:release`

**`crx` will be located in the `build/channel` directory**

Where `channel` is one of the following:
- `dev` (`build/dev/chrome.crx`)
- `beta` (`build/beta/chrome.crx`)
- `release` (`build/release/chrome.crx`)

By default, you will have builds for:

- Chrome — manifest versions **3** (`chrome.crx`)

##### How to generate credentials for `crx` builds

You can use [Crx CLI `keygen`](https://github.com/thom4parisot/crx#crx-keygen-directory)
to generate credentials for `crx` builds, see the example below:

```bash
# Command will generate `key.pem` credential in the `./private/AdguardVPN` directory
pnpm crx keygen ./private/AdguardVPN
```

#### <a name="build-firefox-review"></a> Special building instructions for Firefox reviewers

If you need to build the **BETA** version:

1. To ensure that the extension is built in the same way, use the docker image:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm -it \
        -v $(pwd):/workspace \
        -w /workspace \
        --env-file .env \
        adguard/node-ssh:22.17--0 \
        /bin/sh -c "
            pnpm install && \
            STAGE_ENV=prod \
            pnpm beta firefox"
    ```

1. Compare the generated `build/beta/firefox.zip` file with the uploaded one.

If you need to build the **RELEASE** version:

1. To ensure that the extension is built in the same way, use the docker image:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm -it \
        -v $(pwd):/workspace \
        -w /workspace \
        --env-file .env \
        adguard/node-ssh:22.17--0 \
        /bin/sh -c "
            pnpm install && \
            STAGE_ENV=prod \
            pnpm release firefox"
    ```

1. Compare the generated `build/release/firefox.zip` file with the uploaded one.

### <a name="localization"></a> Localization

- setup your project locales, directories in the file `tasks/locales.js`
- `pnpm locales:upload` used to upload base `en` locale
- `pnpm locales:download` run to download and save all locales
- `pnpm locales:validate` used to validate locales
- `pnpm locales:validate --min` used to validate only major locales

### <a name="proto"></a> Proto scheme update

After every update of proto scheme in the file `src/background/connectivity/connectivity.proto`,
you have to run `pnpm compile-proto`.
This command will update module `src/background/connectivity/protobufCompiled.js` used to build messages
with appropriate scheme for websocket messaging.
