     *      3. retrying connection attempts (probably to another endpoint)

     * Why 70 seconds:
     * There are 2 possible kinds of failures:
     *      1. short term (OOM & restart, deployment of a new version)
     *      2. long term (server dead or brought down intentionally)
     * We don't want our users rambling between endpoints and overloading them when (1) occurs,
     * so we bring in 70 seconds threshold after which we treat the unavailability as (2)
     * and try find another one (backend probably has alternatives in this case).
