     * To send a random request, we use worker created from the offscreen document.
     * background service worker -> offscreen document -> worker
     *
     * There are known bugs in Chrome:
     * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1464898
     * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1392461

     * When this bug is fixed, this method can be removed.
